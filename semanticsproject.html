                    YouTube is one of the world’s largest video-sharing platforms, where people can upload, watch, and share videos for free. It has become a major hub for entertainment, education, news, and creativity, attracting billions of users worldwide. From music videos and vlogs to tutorials and live streams, YouTube has grown into a global community that connects creators with audiences of all kinds.

                    The platform was founded in February 2005 by three former PayPal employees—Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim. Their idea was to create an easy way for people to share videos online, something that wasn’t simple at the time. The first video, “Me at the Zoo,” was uploaded by Karim in April 2005. YouTube quickly gained popularity, and in November 2006, Google purchased it for $1.65 billion, fueling its growth into the massive platform it is today
